# What is the 'golden_minuuu_btt_preset
It is based on the [Golden Choas preset](https://community.folivora.ai/t/goldenchaos-btt-the-complete-touch-bar-ui-replacement/1281)
Thanks for you, golden :)

This is the __MacBook's Touch Bar 'BTT Preset'__ that I customized.\




# How can I use this preset??
1. Download file form [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1usBuvMZwIbimJhtmEZlx5221_QS1Ithb?usp=sharing)
   * I'm very sorry to download only form the google drive.\
     That's because I'm the nwebie of the github, so I don't know how to use this tool that every developer use. :(\
     I hope you understand this.
     
2. Improt this on your 'BTT'\
   Menubar(top of the screen) -> 'Presets' -> 'Import Preset' -> choose the file -> import
